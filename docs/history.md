# History Folder Documentation

The `history/` folder contains historical code and prototypes from earlier versions of the application.

## Folder Overview

This folder stores legacy code and prototypes that are kept for reference but are not actively used in the current application.

---

## Files

### `prototype.py`
**Purpose**: Contains the first version/prototype of the entire application.

**How it works**:
- This is the original implementation before the codebase was refactored into modules
- Likely contains a monolithic version of the application
- Kept for historical reference and comparison

**Usage**: 
- Not used in current application
- Reference only - shows evolution of the codebase
- May be useful for understanding original design decisions

**Note**: This file is preserved for historical purposes and should not be modified or used in production.

## Notes

- The history folder is not imported or used by the main application
- Files in this folder are for reference only
- May contain deprecated code patterns or implementations
